## ES-6 and Beyond
---
### Description

This project started from the passion of having a couple of very common application boilerplates made with pure JS [ ES 6 ]. In this repository are gatherd toghether a couple of intersting small projects like those in the vanill_js folder and a few other that are more complex and made in a more generalized way to be ready for any type of usage during Hackathons and any other programming activity.

For the main package of applications the target is to include:
- [ ] A simplified Node.js chat application with / without encryption [ depending on allocated time ]
- [ ] A very basic JS framework that will be probabily moved to another repository for separate development 
- [ ] A front-end for an analytics dashboard [ oriented on a news API to observe different tandancies ]
- [ ] A very simplified emloyees monitorization dashboard
